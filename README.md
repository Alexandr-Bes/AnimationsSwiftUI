**SwiftUI Learning Animations Test Project**

Welcome to the SwiftUI Learning Animations Test Project! This project is designed to help you explore and experiment with animations in SwiftUI, a modern framework for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms.

##Project Overview
The test project focuses on demonstrating various animation techniques available in SwiftUI. It provides a starting point for you to learn, implement, and experiment with animations in a practical way.

## The project includes the following components:

1. **Views**: A set of SwiftUI views that form the user interface of the application.
2. **Animations**: Code examples demonstrating different animation techniques, such as implicit animations, explicit animations, and transitions.
3. **Interactions**: Implementation of interactive animations, including gesture-based interactions.
4. **Helpers**: Utility code and helper functions to simplify animation-related tasks.

## Getting Started
To get started with the SwiftUI Learning Animations Test Project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using your preferred Git client or by downloading the project as a ZIP file.
2. **Open the project**: Launch Xcode and open the project by selecting the root folder of the cloned repository.
3. **Explore the code**: Take some time to familiarize yourself with the project structure, including the views, animations, and helper files.
4. **Run the project**: Build and run the project on the iOS Simulator or a physical device to see the initial user interface.
